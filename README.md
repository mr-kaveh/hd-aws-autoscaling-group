Set Up an Auto Scaling Group

The goal is to create a web server that can scale up and down to meet website traffic demands. For example, if your website is getting a lot of traffic then it adds more EC2 instances to deal with the increased load, and when the traffic goes down, it reduces the number of EC2 instances to save on costs.
