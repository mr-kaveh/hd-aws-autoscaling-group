## Set Up an Auto Scaling Group

The goal is to create a web server that can scale up and down to meet website traffic demands. For example, if your website is getting a lot of traffic then it adds more EC2 instances to deal with the increased load, and when the traffic goes down, it reduces the number of EC2 instances to save on costs.

## VPC
 It involves creating 3 public subnets and 3 private subnets. Here, is where all the resources are created.

## EC2
-   **Security Groups**: The backend security group now only allows inbound traffic from the frontend security group.
-   **Frontend Instances**: Creates 3 frontend EC2 instances in public subnets.
-   **Backend Instances**: Creates 3 backend EC2 instances in private subnets, running Apache web server that prints the instance ID.
-   **Load Balancer**: Sets up an Application Load Balancer with a target group and listener.
-   **Target Group Attachment**: Attaches frontend instances to the load balancerâ€™s target group.
